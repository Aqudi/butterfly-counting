# Butterfly Counting in Bipartite Networks

__BFC.cpp__ is the source code for an exact algorithm and a suite of randomized algorithms to count the number of butterflies in a bipartite network. This is the implementation for our paper on ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00338v4.pdf

__Abstract__: 	We consider the problem of counting motifs in bipartite affiliation networks, such as author-paper, user-product, and actor-movie relations. We focus on counting the number of occurrences of a "butterfly", a complete 2 x 2 biclique, the simplest cohesive higher-order structure in a bipartite graph. Our main contribution is a suite of randomized algorithms that can quickly approximate the number of butterflies in a graph with a provable guarantee on accuracy. An experimental evaluation on large real-world networks shows that our algorithms return accurate estimates within a few seconds, even for networks with trillions of butterflies and hundreds of millions of edges.

_disclaimer_: For the sake of simplicity for reviewers and researchers to understand our implementation, this source code is a little bit different than what we ran on the large bipartite networks. For example, in this implementation we _DO NOT_ remove vertices with degree zero, or we use _vectors_ and _binary_search_ function for edge sampling. However, as mentioned in the paper, we could use _hashsets_ instead of _vectors_.
